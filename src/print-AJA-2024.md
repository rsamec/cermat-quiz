<h2><span>25</span> Where does Hawaiian pizza come from?</h2><blockquote>
<p><strong>The Hawaiian Pizza</strong></p>
<p>Pineapple on pizza? Where does it even come from? Pizza originates in Italy and Italians are proud
of their pizza. But the Hawaiian pizza, topped with ham and pineapple, has nothing to do with
Italy. It was a Greek immigrant called Sam Panopoulos who invented it and first introduced it to
the menu of his restaurant. It was in 1962, three years after Hawaii became the 50th state of the
USA. People loved everything Hawaiian. So, when they started to import Hawaiian pineapple into
North America, Panopoulos had the idea of putting it on a pizza and calling it the Hawaiian pizza.
He immediately brought this idea to life in his restaurant in the province of Ontario, Canada. His
guests loved it or hated it from the beginning. Recently a survey has found that 82% of people like
pineapple, but only 53% like the fruit on their pizza. And you? Do you love it or hate it?</p>

<h2><span>26</span> What does the article say about the unusual library?</h2><blockquote>
<p><strong>An Unusual Library</strong></p>
<p>The phrase goes, ‘<em>One man’s trash is another man’s treasure</em>,’ and garbage collectors in Turkey have
really taken that phrase seriously. A few months ago, they opened a library composed only of books
they found in garbage cans in the country’s capital of Ankara. At the beginning, the library was
planned to be used only by garbage collectors and their families, but as interest grew, it officially
opened to the public. Since then, people have been bringing their unwanted books to leave them
there for somebody else. The library now has over 25,000 books, which is more than some schools in
the area can lend to their readers. Following the success of the library, the garbage collectors want to
do more: they will change an old garbage truck into a mobile library. They want to drive it to nearby
schools so that their students can borrow books they can’t find in their school libraries.</p>

<h2><span>27</span> Why does Paul Barton upload videos onto his YouTube channel?</h2><blockquote>
<p><strong>YouTuber Paul Barton</strong></p>
<p>A man named Paul Barton lives in an Asian rescue centre which takes care of blind and ill elephants.
To cheer them up, Barton plays the piano for them. ‘It’s entertaining for me. If the elephants
hate the music I’m playing, they make loud noises. If they love it, they dance. I have no idea who
taught them to react to music like that,’ smiles Barton. Either way, his playing attracts the animals’
attention. Barton uploads videos of them on his YouTube channel. Most viewers understand that
Barton doesn’t mean to collect money through his videos. They send it anyway for Barton to have
some money for himself. But he keeps none of it. Viewers also send the links to his videos to others.
If they didn’t, Barton would never be able to make so many people interested in the centre. ‘I’m
happy people around the world know about it now. That’s all I intended,’ says Paul Barton.</p>

<p>When Mum asked me to find a retirement home<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn-AJA-2024-28-1" id="fnref-AJA-2024-28-1">[1]</a></sup> for her and Dad last summer, I started looking
for one. But my wife felt that it wasn’t right and that we should move in with my parents and take
care of them ourselves. I had to agree and we decided to move. However, we needed the whole
summer to do it and my parents needed help right away. So, my children offered to take care
of them during the summer. But we didn’t want them to cancel their summer holiday activities,
which is why I decided to hire a nurse instead. I found one quickly and my parents had some
help. The nurse would look after my parents while we were getting ready to move. My parents
agreed to it. When the summer was over, my family and I moved in with my parents. I think they
are much happier with us and our children than they would be in any retirement home.</p>

<p>Estelle and Larry Bam from Cape Town had a wedding reception that all their guests will
remember. A few weeks before their wedding, Larry secretly sent wedding invitations to Estelle’s
favourite celebrities. He didn’t want them to come to the wedding, he just hoped to collect as
many answers as possible, and he did.  Larry couldn’t wait to give the collection of the celebrities’
replies to Estelle at the wedding reception. But when the moment came their parents suddenly
started shouting at each other. Soon other guests started joining them, a fight started and the
wedding reception had to end. Estelle was mad because her husband had lost his wedding ring
while trying to stop the fight. However, when they were alone in their hotel room and Larry
finally gave her the collection, she was happy again. She absolutely didn’t expect that. ‘It was the
best, even better than having our favourite celebrities show up. So I was glad none of them came
in the end because I’d feel embarrassed by the fight,’ said Estelle.</p>

<p><strong>Los Angeles to Chicago or Chicago to Los Angeles with <em>RouteRide</em></strong></p>
<p><em>2,278 miles, 8 states, 3 time zones, 16 days, 1 Vespa: an experience of a lifetime!</em></p>
<ul>
<li>$760 for one or $1,400 for two! Besides all the fuel needed, the price is for:
accommodation, daily breakfast and dinner and accompanying staff. Nothing
extra is included in the price.</li>
<li>The number of clients is limited because of safety. In one 16-day trip there can be
up to 12 couples, or a combination of couples and singles (for example 6 couples
and 12 singles), but never more than 24 participants.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ROUTE PLAN</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In 16 days, you will cover 2,278 miles on Vespa motorbikes. Please don’t forget to check
the technical condition of your Vespa before the trip. If you don’t have time to look at your
Vespa, don’t worry. <em>RouteRide</em> hires mechanics who will check its clients’ motorbikes at the
places of departure. If you don’t have a Vespa and you plan to ride a rented one, please have
it checked by the rental company. <em>RouteRide</em> does not provide any Vespas.</li>
<li>To make it to your destination in 16 days, you will need to ride your motorbike 143 miles
a day. At an average speed of 25 mph, this can be done in 5 h 45 min. However, the trip is<br>
not only about riding a motorbike, it’s also about making stops at interesting sites along the
way. To visit everything as planned, you will set out on the journey every day just as the sun
comes up.</li>
<li>Please note that some sections of Route 66 run through states with dangerous wild
animals and hot and dry weather, especially Arizona. However, the animals there are not
as dangerous as the heat. The heat can make you unable to continue riding your Vespa so
remember to drink a lot of water.</li>
<li>Although the plan has been carefully put together by <em>RouteRide</em>’s experienced guides,
changes are possible. However, <em>RouteRide</em> will not make any if they are not informed of your
wishes before the whole trip starts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ACCOMMODATION</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>RouteRide</em> has had the best experience with motels along local roads off Route 66. Their
rooms are as cosy as the rooms in the motels along Route 66, but much cheaper. That’s why
<em>RouteRide</em> books rooms in them for you. Remember: breakfast and dinner are included!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ROUTE L: Los Angeles → Chicago</strong>
<strong>August 1 – August 16</strong></p>
<p><strong>Registration</strong>: Any time before departure but no later than the day before departure. Your
registration will be confirmed within an hour via text message.</p>
<p><strong>Departure</strong>: From <em>RouteRide</em>’s car park on the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and Vine Street.</p>
<p><strong>Arrival</strong>: The Main Station car park on the corner of Jefferson and Jackson Boulevard. <em>RouteRide</em>
is allowed to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Service</strong>: Apart from our two experienced guides, Pedro and Nia, a nurse, a mechanic and a driver
of the accompanying vehicle will be part of the staff who take care of you during the whole trip.</p>
<p><strong>ROUTE C: Chicago → Los Angeles</strong>
<strong>August 17 – September 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Registration</strong>: Any time before departure until July 31. By August 4, <em>RouteRide</em> will confirm your

<p><strong>Departure</strong>: From the petrol station on the corner of Jefferson and Jackson Boulevard, opposite
<em>RouteRide</em>’s car park.</p>
<p><strong>Arrival</strong>: <em>RouteRide</em>’s car park on the corner of Santa Monica Boulevard and Vine Street.</p>
<p><strong>Service</strong>: You will be accompanied by two excellent guides: Shanice, who is also a nurse, and
Old Mike (25 years of experience!), who will also be your mechanic in case your Vespa breaks
down. Besides them, Jim, the driver of the accompanying vehicle, will also be part of the staff<br>
during the trip.</p>

<p>I decided to write a letter to you. I don’t think I’ve ever used this way of communication with
anyone, except maybe with my Grandma when I was little. See, the idea came to me when
I saw a colleague writing a letter by hand because his phone had died shortly before my arrival
here. So, he gave up calling his girlfriend and just sat down and started to write. How romantic!
So, despite having the opportunity to be online here, I went for writing a letter by hand instead
of e-mailing or texting you. I feel so old-fashioned! Just like when my Grandpa was in Vietnam
writing letters to my Grandma. She showed me the letters once, they were in an old box. But
you don’t have to keep this letter in a box and open it again when we’re old if you don’t want
to. I just hope you feel my love more when you’re holding this.</p>
<p>Anyway, my flight from London to Haiti was okay. A big, unpleasant surprise came when I got
to the hospital. I was told there were no more flats for foreign doctors at that moment. So, I’m
sleeping on an old bed in the doctors’ room for now, hoping the situation changes soon. And
work, Celia? I had a 12-hour shift, and then two more shifts just as long! Three days in a row!
I was so exhausted afterwards that I cried. I’d never cried after work before! But don’t worry
about me, I’m okay now. I simply must remember to eat and drink during my shifts. I’ve found
the local cuisine amazing! The meals are rich and tasty. I hate to say it, but English cuisine isn’t
as good. I don’t miss the cold sea at home either. The Caribbean Sea here is so much warmer.
My colleagues and I had so much fun swimming in it yesterday on our day off. It was my first
swim here. The beaches are a bit dirty, but it didn’t bother us.</p>
<p>And how are you, my love? Do you miss me? I miss you terribly. I had to stop drinking black
tea with milk here. Can you imagine? Me, an Englishman, not drinking tea! It is because it
reminded me of you and our afternoon tea together. And I started to miss you. Also, when I see
a girl in the hospital who looks like you, perhaps I look at her for too long. Sometimes I feel like
I see you everywhere. There are more things that make me miss you, but none is worse than
seeing couples holding hands. Those are the moments I really wish you were here with me.
Sometimes I drink a glass of sweet wine in the evening and think of you; what you are doing,
if you’re alright… I love such evenings here the most.</p>
<p>When I go to bed, I hope that you will be in my dreams. Do you feel like that too? I’d be in your
dreams every night if it was up to me, my love. Why haven’t you been in any of mine yet? I used
to dream about you twice a week before I came here. And now? Nothing. But I’ve dreamt about
my mum three times here already. Funny, isn’t it? Could you please also be in mine at least
once while I’m in Haiti? That way we could be together for a while.
Now, I’m just counting the days until we see each other next month. I can’t wait! My flight will
be much shorter than the one over here to Port-au-Prince, but I have to change planes once
because there is no direct flight to Orlando. It’s a pity I can’t go all the way to New York City,
honey. I know that would be the best plan for you, but I just can’t afford to go any further than
Orlando. Maybe some other time? Anyway, like I said I can’t wait to hug you and kiss you again.
I’ll be waiting for your flight from Paris at the airport.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>George</p>
